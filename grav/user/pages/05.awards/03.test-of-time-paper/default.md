## Test-of-Time Paper Awards

**Description**

The SIGMOBILE Test-of-Time awards recognize papers that have had a sustained and significant impact in the SIGMOBILE community over at least a decade. The award recognizes that a paper's influence is often not fully apparent at the time of publication, and it can be best judged with the perspective of time.

All papers published at least 10 years ago in a SIGMOBILE venue are eligible for this award. In addition, papers published at least 10 years ago in other venues are also eligible if they have had an exceptional influence on the SIGMOBILE community. The papers are judged by their influence since publication. The award includes an honorarium for each paper to be split amongst the authors and an award certificate of recognition for each author. A public citation for award papers will be placed on the SIGMOBILE website.

**Selection Committee**

The current SIGMOBILE Executive Committee shall appoint a chair of the selection committee for the award. The chair, in consultation with the Executive Committee, will appoint additional members to the committee. The committee will comprise of at least three members. Committee members will typically be invited from among the Technical Program Committee (TPC) Chairs of major SIGMOBILE conferences of the current year as well as from major SIGMOBILE conferences held ten years back. In addition, other established members of the SIGMOBILE community can also be invited to be part of the committee. For the sake of continuity, we will strive to retain at least one member of the selection committee in the next year. Finally, members may serve in the committee for up to three consecutive years.

**Proposed Procedure**

All papers published in a SIGMOBILE-sponsored conference are automatically eligible for the award. In addition, exceptional papers that were published outside SIGMOBILE sponsored venues can also be considered through this nomination process. In each case, the papers in consideration have to be published at least ten years prior to the year in which they are being considered for the award.

A paper that appeared in SIGMOBILE sponsored venues can be nominated by any individual by submitting a nomination letter outlining the significance of the work and reasons why the paper deserves the award. The selection committee for the award is encouraged to seek the opinion of the TPC chairs of the SIGMOBILE-sponsored conferences from ten years ago as well as the TPC chairs from the current year in seeking good nomination candidates.

Any other paper, not included through the above process, can be nominated by any individual, by submitting a nomination letter and two additional letters of support (not from authors), outlining the significance of the work and reasons why the paper deserves the award.

The selection committee has the prerogative to make no award, as well as to make multiple awards in each year. The awards should reflect the breadth of work of the entire SIGMOBILE community and as such the selection committee is encouraged to make multiple awards to reflect this.

Because SIGMOBILE sponsored conferences have been ongoing for more than ten years, it is expected that in the first ten years of this award, additional awards will be given to catch up (i.e., in the initial years from 2 to 4 awards would be given and after that 1 to 2 awards would be presented).

**2018 ACM SIGMOBILE Test-of-Time Paper Awardees**

M. Satyanarayanan, “Pervasive Computing: Vision and Challenges,” IEEE Personal Communications, 8(4), August 2001.
> The paper connects the vision of pervasive computing to distributed systems and mobile computing as we knew them then, then draws fundamental observations of what system components still needed to be developed and how. The paper is a travel in time. What we call today the “Internet of Things” was already described here, along with many other fundamental concepts such as edge computing, cloud offloading, energy-driven adaptation, thick and thin clients. As an eminent example of abstract thinking, the author revealed the essence of each and every research challenge independent of the technology available back then.

Charles E. Perkins and Elizabeth M. Royer. “Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing,” ACM Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (WMCSA), 1999
> This paper presents AODV, perhaps the most influential ad hoc routing protocol to date. This algorithm proposes a novel and suitable solution for the operation of these dynamic and unstable networks. Its major impact on the industry and related standards demonstrate the practical importance of this work. Additionally, the protocol is a “must-teach” in academic curricula related to mobile networking.

Eugene Shih, Paramvir Bahl and Michael J. Sinclair, “Wake on Wireless: An Event Driven Energy Saving Strategy for Battery Operated Devices,” ACM MobiCom 2002. 
> This paper pioneered the systematic use of low- and high-power radios in a battery-constrained device, by separating data and control channels, to minimize overall energy consumption. The approach is now used commonly in today’s mobile devices. Additionally, the rigorous experimental approach had a significant impact on the research methodology in mobile computing community. 

Jitendra Padhye, Victor Firoiu, Don Towsley and Jim Kurose, “Modeling TCP throughput: A simple model and its empirical validation,” 28(4),  ACM SIGCOMM, 1998. 
> The TCP model presented in this work is arguably the one that  significantly influenced the SIGMOBILE community. Not only elegantly simple but also capable of accurately predicting TCP’s throughput over a very wide range of loss rates. After two decades, it is still taught in several networking classes, and often used as a starting point for related modeling research.

Rudolf Ahlswede, Ning Cai,  Shuo-Yen Robert Li and Raymond W. Yeung, “Network Information Flow,” 46(4), IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, July 2000.
> This is the seminal work on network coding that had a profound impact on the networking and mobile systems communities. The information theoretic analysis led to significant academic work for more than a decade in the networking community on leveraging network coding to build systems that achieve higher reliability and throughput. 

Bret Hull, Vladimir Bychkovsky, Yang Zhang, Kevin Chen, Michel Goraczko, Allen K. Miu, Eugene Shih, Hari Balakrishnan and Samuel Madden, “CarTel: A Distributed Mobile Sensor Computing System,” ACM SenSys 2006. 
> This seminal paper proposed to leverage commodity sensing units on on-the-road vehicles to revolutionize the monitoring of road traffic and road hazard/surface for improving road safety. In addition to significant academic impact, the paper also generated real-world impact with the proposed concept being widely adopted in popular map applications. Additionally, the network stack designs to tolerate intermittent connectivity also had an impact on delay-tolerant mobile networking, including those targeting remote inaccessible regions.
