## About SIGMOBILE

SIGMOBILE was formed in 1996 as an international ACM community of researchers and practitioners who:
* Perform research in the theory and practice of all areas related to the mobility of systems, users, data, and computing;
* Expand the evolution of portable computers and wireless networks;
* Support the convergence of mobility, computing, and information organization; and
* Improve access, services, management, and applications for mobile computing and communications.

### Publications
SIGMOBILE's quarterly journal, Mobile Computing and Communications Review (MC2R), is the leading publication in this rapidly evolving field. The Proceedings of the MobiCom International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking summarize the year's most advanced and significant work. SIGMOBILE also publishes Wireless Networks: The Journal of Mobile Communication, Computation and Information, and Mobile Networks and Applications: The Journal of SPECIAL ISSUES on Mobility of Systems, Users, Data and Computing.
